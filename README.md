# Metaheuristic CVRPTW solver 
In this work we construct two algorithms for solving the capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows - namely a Genetic Algorithm and Ant Colony Optimisation.
For more details see the writeup pdf.

## Usage
To run the program, simply run the following command in the root directory:
```python3 main.py --algorithm [GA|ACO]```
or to search fro parameters:
```python3 main.py --search_best_configuration [GA|ACO]```
